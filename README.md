#  NBA Chrome Extension

## UPDATE 2021
I wrote this in University and this might have been the worst code I've written. But it works and please feel free to use it! Only supports EST now but plan on adding tiem zone support in future. 


this chrome extension is available on the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nba-game-alert/eenjjidegjlphgaapdolmhdhoongphmf) under the name `NBA game alert`. 
## Chrome extension that allows user to keep track of the games that are happening that day as well as allows users to track 
## their favorite teams via the option button. Here are some screenshots of what the app looks like.
